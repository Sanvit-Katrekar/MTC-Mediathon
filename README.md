# MTC Mediathon Challenge
This is a static HTML,CSS based website created as a serious submission to MTC BPDC for their Big Mediathon Event!

Our team, The Mavericks used the template made by MTC BPDC, and managed to absolutely ruin it :)

We chose the theme: **Sports** since I know MTC BPDC members majority are sports people, so thought we could take advantage!

PS: Although we could not devote much time for creating the best Portfolio website, it was a fun event to participate in, loved it! 
Keep the grind going, MTC!
